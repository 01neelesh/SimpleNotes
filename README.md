### Login Screen
The app begins with a **Google Sign-In** screen. If the user is not logged in, they are prompted to log in using their Google account. Upon successful login, the app stores the user's email locally using SharedPreferences, enabling seamless authentication across sessions.

### Notes Management
After logging in, users are directed to the Notes Management screen where they can view all of their notes in a **RecyclerView**.

- **Add Note:** Users can create a new note by tapping the "Add" button. A dialog box appears where they can input the note's content.
- **Update Note:** Users can select any note and update its content.
- **Delete Note:** Each note has a delete option, allowing the user to remove notes permanently.
The app uses **SQLite** for local storage, implemented with **Room**, ensuring that all notes persist between sessions.
